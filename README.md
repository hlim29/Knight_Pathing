# Knight Pathing
A coding challenge solution. Written in Java

## Scenario
Given a standard 8x8 chessboard, design an object oriented application that accepts two squares identified by algebraic chess notation. The first square is the starting position, and the second square is the ending position. Find the shortest sequence of valid moves to take a Knight piece from the starting position to the ending position. Each move must be a legal move by a Knight and you can assume there are no other pieces on the board. For any two squares there may be more than one valid solution.

## How to run
In order to run the program, import the archive into Eclipse. Compile it and run the 'main(String[] args)' method in the 'Main' class. No arguments are required for the main method.

## Input
Must be two squares identified in algebraic chess notation representing the starting and ending positions of the Knight. The two squares are separated by a space.
## Output
Must be a list of squares through which the Knight passes, in algebraic chess notation.
#### Example
#####Test Input: A8 B7
#####Expected Output: A8->C7, C7->E6, E6->C5, C5->B7
